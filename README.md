# Customer Churn Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains a data analytics project that focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn refers to the rate at which customers stop using a company's services. Predicting churn is crucial for businesses as it helps in retaining valuable customers and improving overall customer satisfaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [source_name]. It contains information about customers, including their demographics, services subscribed to, contract details, and whether they churned or not.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Inspection**: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand its structure, features, and any missing data.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and encoding categorical variables.

3. **Data Exploration (EDA)**: Visualizing data, generating insights, and understanding the relationships between variables.

4. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.

5. **Data Splitting**: Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets for model development and evaluation.

6. **Model Selection**: Choosing a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting) for predicting churn.

7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tuning the model's hyperparameters to optimize its performance using GridSearchCV.

8. **Final Model Training**: Training the final model with the best hyperparameters using the entire training dataset.

9. **Final Evaluation**: Evaluating the final model's performance using various metrics, including ROC AUC, confusion matrix, and feature importance.

10. **Deployment**: Deploying the model as an API to make real-time predictions on new data.
